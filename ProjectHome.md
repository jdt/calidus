Calidus is a C# code style analysis tool that provides a set of rules to validate C# code on a number of different criteria such as documentation, layout, spacing....

Built from the ground up with testability and extensibility in mind Calidus provides not only a set of configurable rules but a complete framework where developers can build, test and run custom rules.

There is more information on Calidus available on the blog of the lead developer at http://jdt.toron.be/blog
